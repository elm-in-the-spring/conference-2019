# Elm in the Spring 2019 Website Reboot

ðŸ˜» A brand new website for Elm in the Spring Conference 2019 ðŸŒ·


## Why the new site?

Accessibility! Our old site was nice but it wasn't very accessible. Thanks to this [extemely helpful issue](https://github.com/ryannhg/elm-in-the-spring/issues/5), this was brought to our attention and we were able to make some improvements!

This project is bootstrapped with [Create Elm App](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app). See [here](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app/blob/master/template/README.md) for additional instruction on available development features.
